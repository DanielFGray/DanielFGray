## Hello world! 👋

I'm Dan (he/him), I build websites. I'm a big fan of Node.js and [React ⚛](https://reactjs.org), and lately TypeScript as wellt. Other libraries and technologies I enjoy using include:

* **[Redux](https://redux.js.org)** - especially since [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* **[PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/)** - generates a GraphQL schema using [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) introspection
* **[Ramda.js 🐏](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)** - I wrote a pull request to add the P combinator as [R.on](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/commit/f181e06a9d8982a65a829b29410a3765c66f14a2#diff-085407b1efefd1e07aeceeb39e329c4c)

As a Linux 🐧 user, I like to make use of the command line and automate things with Bash scripts<sup>([[1]](https://github.com/danielfgray/dotfiles)[[2]](https://github.com/danielfgray/bin)[[3]](https://github.com/danielfgray/fzf-scripts))</sup>.

I also have experience with several other languages, including:

* Perl
* Python
* Haskell
* Rust

Outside of programming, I teach teach music 🎼, play drums 🥁 in bands, and attempt to play guitar (at home). Peep the [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/danielfgray)!
