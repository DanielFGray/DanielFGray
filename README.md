## Hello world! 👋

I'm Dan, and I build software. I'm a big fan of Node.js, ReactJS, TypeScript. Other libraries and technologies I enjoy using include:
 
* [**Postgres**](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the world's most advanced database, is an integral part of almost every app I build.
* **[PostGraphile](https://www.postgraphile.org/)** - generates GraphQL schemas using introspection data from your Postgres database. The [graphile-starter](https://github.com/graphile/starter) is amazing!
* **[Redux](https://redux.js.org)** - especially since **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)**, is great for managing complex application state. you might check out my [ts-redux-frontend](https://github.com/DanielFGray/ts-redux-frontend/) I made to explore some of it's features.
* **[Ramda.js 🐏](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)** - I enjoy "functional" programming, and often find myself leaning on Ramda. I wrote a request to add the P combinator as [R.on](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/commit/f181e06a9d8982a65a829b29410a3765c66f14a2#diff-085407b1efefd1e07aeceeb39e329c4c).

[I have a blog](https://danielfgray.com) where I often write about various programming-related things, and occasionally about music.

As a Linux 🐧 user, I like to make use of the command line and automate things with Bash scripts. <sup>([[1]](https://github.com/danielfgray/dotfiles)[[2]](https://github.com/danielfgray/bin)[[3]](https://github.com/danielfgray/fzf-scripts))</sup> 

I have some experience with other languages as well, such as Python, Rust, Haskell, and Clojure.

Outside of programming, I teach teach music 🎼, play drums 🥁 in bands, and attempt to play guitar (at home). Peep the [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/danielfgray)!
